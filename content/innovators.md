It is difficult for Innovators to test new products in an industry setting,
to be able to deliver commercial solutions to the industrial sector.

At the Living Lab, we aim to assist Innovators by providing an opportunity to trial their product, demonstrating adherence to safety, installation, commissioning and removal procedures. Our team will conduct the trial on UWA's industrial grade infrastructure, as a pathway for derisking future deployment opportunities.

Are you an innovator seeking to trial in a real life setup?
