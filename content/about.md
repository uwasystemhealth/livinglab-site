The Living Lab @UWA is a project helping innovators test their products on industrial facilities and processes. The project makes available industrial facilties and processes at the University of Western Australia as a proving ground for innovators to bridge the gap from idea to mine site.

In 2018 the SHL received a grant from the Australian Governmentâ€™s METS Ignited Collaborative Project Fund for the Living Lab @UWA program. This is a collaboration between CORE Innovation Hub, the UWA Facilities Management group, and the SHL with support from the BHP Strategy and Innovation group to support startups to conduct product site trials at UWA as a critical step to a mine site trial. The trials will be managed by students working in the SHL providing invaluable project management and technical experience.
