In 2018 the SHL received a $100K grant from the Australian Governmentâ€™s METS Ignited Collaborative Project Fund for the LivingLab@UWA program. This is a collaboration between CORE Innovation Hub, the UWA Facilities Management group, and the SHL with support from the BHP Strategy and Innovation group to support startups to conduct product site trials at UWA as a critical step to a mine site trial. The trials will be managed by students working in the SHL providing invaluable project management and technical experience.
